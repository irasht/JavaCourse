THE ECLIPSE
Next is a signature black, to show the poles of my versatility, if you like. It was the darkest moment before the
dawn.
This time, I had come for a man of perhaps twenty-four years of age. It was a beautiful thing in some ways. The
plane was still coughing. Smoke was leaking from both its lungs.
When it crashed, three deep gashes were made in the earth. Its wings were now sawn-off arms. No more
flapping. Not for this metallic little bird.
SOME OTHER SMALL FACTS
Sometimes I arrive too early.
I rush,
and some people cling longer
to life than expected.
After a small collection of minutes, the smoke exhausted itself. There was nothing left to give.
A boy arrived first, with cluttered breath and what appeared to be a toolbox. With great trepidation, he
approached the cockpit and watched the pilot, gauging if he was alive, at which point, he still was. The book
thief arrived perhaps thirty seconds later.
Years had passed, but I recognized her.
She was panting.
